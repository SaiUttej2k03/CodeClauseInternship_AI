# CodeClauseInternship_ObjectDetectionSystem
This is the task given under the internship done in Code Clause, Used Yolo for detection of objects and extracted the data from Kaggle data source

# Project Title
Object Detection with YOLO and Data Extraction from Kaggle
Project Description
This project was completed as part of my internship at Code Clause under the domain of Artificial Intelligence. It involves the use of YOLO (You Only Look Once), an object detection algorithm, to identify and locate objects in images. Additionally, data was extracted from a Kaggle data source for further analysis and training of the YOLO model.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
YOLOv3 pre-trained weights (provide a link or instructions on how to obtain them)
Necessary Python libraries (e.g., OpenCV, Numpy)
Kaggle API credentials (if applicable)
